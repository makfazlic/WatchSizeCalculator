# WatchSizeCalculator

If in need of a shirt, you will already have the size you need in mind. With wristwatches, it is the same story. Stylistically correct watch size has a little to do with personal preference, and more to do with your body type, like any other fashion accessory. Ensuring perfect fit is important when it comes to highlighting your individuality and personal style. So, we suggest you try to stay within the presented boundaries, but in case the watch you truly want is not within these boundaries, we say go for it.

Metrics are derived from measurements taken from well-known watch manufacturers such as Rolex, Omega, Seiko, and many others. These were examined and compiled with several adjustments to ensure the correct calculation and the best possible fit. We also present you with a lug-to-lug distance which is, in our opinion, the most accurate and the most overlooked watch size metric. These were compiled in an easy-to-operate calculator with the inclusion of our printable measurement guides which are yours to keep.

We are trying to create a new movement of conscious watch buyers that understand what watches fit their wrist and their lifestyle. By doing so, we inspire them to buy the best watches and be confident in wearing them.
